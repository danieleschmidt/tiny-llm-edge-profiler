# Project Charter: tiny-llm-edge-profiler

## Project Overview

### Mission Statement
To democratize access to comprehensive profiling and optimization of quantized Large Language Models (LLMs) on microcontrollers and edge devices, enabling developers to deploy AI capabilities on ultra-low-power hardware with confidence and precision.

### Problem Statement
The deployment of LLMs on edge devices is hindered by:
- Lack of standardized profiling tools for microcontrollers
- Difficulty measuring real-world performance on resource-constrained devices  
- No unified framework for comparing models across diverse hardware platforms
- Limited visibility into power consumption and energy efficiency
- Complex optimization process requiring deep hardware expertise

### Solution Approach
Develop a comprehensive, open-source profiling toolkit that provides:
- Unified API for profiling across ARM, RISC-V, and Xtensa architectures
- Real-time measurement of latency, memory usage, and power consumption
- Automated model optimization for specific hardware targets
- Comparative analysis tools for model and hardware selection
- Standardized benchmarking suite for the TinyML community

## Scope Definition
