Recent surveys by [TinyML Research 2025] and [Edge AI Technology Report 2025] highlight the growing need for sophisticated profiling tools for edge AI deployment. Traditional approaches focus on individual optimization objectives, lacking the comprehensive multi-objective perspective required for real-world deployment.

Existing profiling frameworks such as EdgeProfiler [ArXiv 2506.09061] provide analytical modeling but lack the adaptive optimization capabilities demonstrated in our research. Our work extends beyond static profiling to dynamic, learning-based optimization.

### 2.3 Autonomous Hardware-Software Co-optimization

Microsoft Research's advances in low-bit quantization and hardware-software co-design provide the foundation for our autonomous optimization approach. The Ladder compiler and T-MAC library demonstrated the potential for intelligent hardware-aware optimization.

Our AEPCO algorithm extends these concepts with meta-learning and transfer learning capabilities, enabling autonomous adaptation to diverse hardware characteristics.
