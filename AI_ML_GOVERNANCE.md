        "training_validation",  # Convergence, overfitting, metrics
        "quantization_test",    # Accuracy retention, compression ratio
        "edge_performance",     # Latency, memory, power consumption
        "security_scan",        # Adversarial robustness, privacy
        "ethical_review",       # Bias assessment, fairness metrics
        "regulatory_check",     # Compliance with AI regulations
        "production_approval"   # Final sign-off for deployment
    ]
    
    required_approvers = {
        "data_scientist": ["data_validation", "training_validation"],
        "ml_engineer": ["quantization_test", "edge_performance"],
