# ADR-001: Platform Abstraction Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The tiny-llm-edge-profiler needs to support a wide variety of microcontrollers and edge devices, each with different architectures (ARM Cortex-M, RISC-V, Xtensa), communication protocols, and resource constraints. We need a strategy that allows consistent profiling across platforms while maintaining the ability to leverage platform-specific optimizations.

## Decision
Implement a three-layer platform abstraction strategy:

1. **Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)**: Standardized interface for device communication, memory management, and timing
2. **Platform Adapters**: Device-specific implementations that map HAL interfaces to actual hardware capabilities
3. **Optimization Plugins**: Optional platform-specific optimizations that can be applied when supported

This approach uses a plugin architecture where new platforms can be added by implementing the standard interfaces without modifying core profiling logic.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Consistent API across all supported platforms
- Easy addition of new platform support
- Clear separation of concerns between profiling logic and platform specifics
- Ability to leverage platform-specific optimizations when available
- Simplified testing through mock platform implementations

### Negative
- Additional abstraction layer may introduce minimal performance overhead
- More complex initial implementation compared to platform-specific solutions
- Requires careful interface design to accommodate diverse hardware capabilities

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Platform-Specific Implementations**: Separate codebases for each platform
   - Rejected: Would lead to code duplication and maintenance overhead

2. **Lowest Common Denominator**: Single implementation targeting most basic capabilities
   - Rejected: Would prevent leveraging advanced platform features

3. **Configuration-Based Approach**: Single implementation with extensive configuration
   - Rejected: Would be complex and difficult to maintain

## Implementation Notes
- HAL interfaces will be defined as abstract base classes in Python
- Platform adapters will be discovered dynamically using entry points
- Optimization plugins will be optional and loaded based on platform capabilities
- All platform-specific code will be isolated in separate modules
