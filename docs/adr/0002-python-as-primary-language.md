# ADR-0002: Python as Primary Language for Host Tools

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to choose a primary programming language for the host-side profiling tools. The requirements include:
- Rich ecosystem for data analysis and machine learning
- Cross-platform support (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- Easy integration with edge device communication
- Strong community and library support for scientific computing
- Ability to interface with C/C++ code for performance-critical components

## Decision
We will use Python 3.8+ as the primary language for host-side tools including the profiler engine, analysis tools, and CLI interface.

## Alternatives Considered

### Python
- **Pros**: Excellent ML/data science ecosystem (NumPy, SciPy, Pandas), easy prototyping, cross-platform, strong serial communication libraries
- **Cons**: Performance limitations, GIL for threading, larger memory footprint

### Rust
- **Pros**: Memory safety, excellent performance, growing ecosystem, good cross-compilation support
- **Cons**: Steeper learning curve, smaller ML ecosystem, less mature data analysis libraries

### Go
- **Pros**: Good performance, excellent concurrency, easy deployment, cross-compilation
- **Cons**: Limited scientific computing libraries, smaller ML ecosystem

### C++
- **Pros**: Maximum performance, direct hardware access, mature ecosystem
- **Cons**: Development complexity, platform-specific builds, limited high-level data analysis tools

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Rapid Development**: Python's expressiveness enables faster iteration
- **Rich Ecosystem**: Access to NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Matplotlib for data analysis
- **ML Integration**: Easy integration with PyTorch, ONNX, and other ML frameworks
- **Device Communication**: Excellent serial/USB communication libraries
- **Testing**: Mature testing frameworks (pytest, hypothesis)
- **Documentation**: Great tools for documentation generation

### Negative
- **Performance**: Slower than compiled languages for CPU-intensive tasks
- **Memory Usage**: Higher memory footprint than compiled alternatives
- **Packaging**: More complex deployment compared to single binaries
- **Threading**: GIL limitations for CPU-bound parallel processing

## Mitigation Strategies
- Use NumPy/SciPy for performance-critical numerical operations
- Implement performance-critical edge device firmware in C/C++
- Use multiprocessing instead of threading for CPU-bound parallelism
- Consider Cython or C extensions for specific hot paths if needed
- Use Docker for consistent deployment environments
