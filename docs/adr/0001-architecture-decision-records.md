# ADR-0001: Use Architecture Decision Records

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need a way to record the architectural decisions made on this project, including the context and consequences of each decision. As the project grows in complexity with multiple edge platforms, quantization strategies, and performance requirements, it becomes crucial to document why certain technical choices were made.

## Decision
We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to document architectural decisions for this project. ADRs will be stored in the `docs/adr` directory and numbered sequentially.

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Documentation**: Important architectural decisions are captured with context
- **Knowledge Transfer**: New team members can understand historical decisions
- **Decision Tracking**: Easy to see when and why decisions were made
- **Change Management**: Provides basis for evaluating when to change decisions

### Negative
- **Overhead**: Requires discipline to write ADRs for significant decisions
- **Maintenance**: ADRs need to be kept up-to-date when decisions change

## Implementation
- ADRs will be written in Markdown format
- Each ADR will be numbered sequentially (e.g., 0001, 0002, etc.)
- ADRs will follow the format: Title, Status, Context, Decision, Consequences
- ADRs will be reviewed as part of the code review process
- Superseded ADRs will be marked as such but not deleted
