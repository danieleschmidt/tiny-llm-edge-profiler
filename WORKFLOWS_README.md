# GitHub Workflows Setup

Due to GitHub App permissions limitations, the CI/CD workflow files need to be manually added to the repository. This document provides instructions for setting up the complete automation pipeline.

## üìÅ Workflow Files to Add

The following workflow files are ready for manual addition to `.github/workflows/`:

### Core Workflows
- **`ci.yml`** - Comprehensive Continuous Integration pipeline
- **`cd.yml`** - Continuous Deployment with staging and production environments  
- **`security.yml`** - Security scanning automation (CodeQL, SAST, DAST, container scanning)
- **`dependency-update.yml`** - Automated dependency updates and security patches

## üöÄ Quick Setup Instructions

1. **Create the workflows directory** (if it doesn't exist):
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .github/workflows
   ```

2. **Copy the workflow files**:
   ```bash
   # Copy all workflow files from the workflows-to-add directory
   cp workflows-to-add/*.yml .github/workflows/
   ```

3. **Configure repository settings**:
   - Enable **Dependabot security updates** in repository settings
   - Set up **branch protection rules** for main branch
   - Configure **required status checks** for CI workflows

4. **Add repository secrets** (if needed):
   ```
   SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL     # For deployment notifications
   SNYK_TOKEN           # For security scanning
   PYPI_API_TOKEN       # For package publishing
   ```

## üìã Workflow Overview

### üîÑ Continuous Integration (`ci.yml`)
- **Triggers**: Push to main/develop, pull requests, scheduled runs
- **Features**: 
  - Matrix testing across Python 3.8-3.12 and OS (Ubuntu, Windows, macOS)
  - Code quality checks (Black, isort, flake8, pylint, mypy)
  - Security scanning (Bandit, Safety, pip-audit)
  - Comprehensive test suite (unit, integration, hardware)
  - Documentation building and link checking
  - Docker container building and testing
  - Performance benchmarking

### üöÄ Continuous Deployment (`cd.yml`)
- **Triggers**: Main branch pushes, tags, releases, manual dispatch
- **Features**:
  - Pre-deployment validation with full test suite
  - Multi-platform container image building (amd64, arm64)
  - Staging deployment with smoke tests
  - Production deployment with manual approval gates
  - Package publishing to PyPI for releases
  - Slack notifications for deployment status

### üîí Security Scanning (`security.yml`)
- **Triggers**: Push/PR to main, scheduled daily runs, manual dispatch
- **Features**:
  - CodeQL analysis for vulnerability detection
  - SAST scanning with Bandit and Semgrep
  - Container security scanning with Trivy
  - Infrastructure as Code scanning with Checkov
  - Secret detection with TruffleHog and GitLeaks
  - License compliance checking
  - SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) generation

### ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Dependency Updates (`dependency-update.yml`)
- **Triggers**: Weekly scheduled runs, manual dispatch
- **Features**:
  - Security vulnerability scanning and patching
  - Automated dependency updates (patch, minor, major)
  - GitHub Actions version updates
  - Container base image updates
  - Automated PR creation with test validation

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Configuration

### Branch Protection Rules
Configure the following for the `main` branch:
- ‚úÖ Require pull request reviews
- ‚úÖ Require status checks to pass before merging
- ‚úÖ Require up-to-date branches before merging
- ‚úÖ Include administrators
- ‚úÖ Restrict pushes to matching branches

### Required Status Checks
Add these checks as required:
- `Code Quality Checks`
- `Test Suite (ubuntu-latest, 3.11)`
- `Documentation`
- `Docker Build & Test`

## üîß Customization Options

### Environment-specific Configuration
The workflows support multiple environments through GitHub Environments:
- **staging** - Automatic deployment from main branch
- **production** - Manual approval required for deployment

### Notification Configuration
Add Slack webhook URL to repository secrets for deployment notifications:
```yaml
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL: https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/SLACK/WEBHOOK
```

### Security Scanning Configuration
Optional: Add Snyk token for enhanced vulnerability scanning:
```yaml
SNYK_TOKEN: your-snyk-api-token
```

## üìä Monitoring and Observability

### Workflow Metrics
The workflows generate comprehensive reports:
- Test coverage reports (uploaded as artifacts)
- Security scan results (integrated with GitHub Security tab)
- Performance benchmarks (tracked over time)
- Build artifacts (packages, containers)

### Integration with External Tools
The workflows are designed to integrate with:
- **Codecov** for coverage reporting
- **Snyk** for vulnerability scanning
- **Slack** for notifications
- **PyPI** for package publishing
- **GitHub Container Registry** for container images

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Workflow permissions**: Ensure GitHub Actions has required permissions
2. **Secret configuration**: Verify all required secrets are properly configured
3. **Branch protection**: Check that branch protection rules don't conflict with automation

### Testing Workflows
Before enabling on main branch:
1. Test workflows on a feature branch first
2. Review workflow runs in the Actions tab
3. Verify all integrations work correctly

Once these workflows are added, the repository will have a complete, production-ready CI/CD pipeline with comprehensive security scanning and automation capabilities.
